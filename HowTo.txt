  Arduino (I used clone of Arduino Nano, but UNO is fully supported)
  2x DS18B20 thermometer
  DHT11 or DHT22 (DHT22 is better)
  BMP085 preassure sensor
  LDR resistor 
  LED diode
  2x 4K7 resisotr 
  560 OHM resistor (it depends on LED)
  Prototyping board and wires
  MiniUSB cable (it depends on version of Ardiono)
  2A 5V power supply with MicroUSB
